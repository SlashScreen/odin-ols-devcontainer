This is a devcontainer for development with Odin and OLS. It automatically builds from master, and installs the ols server and the extension.  
To use it, use it as the base to your DevContainer file:
```json
{
    "name": "My DevContainer",
    "image": "ghcr.io/slashscreen/odin-ols-devcontainer:latest",
}
```
